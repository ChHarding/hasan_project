# bugs.md (Version 1)

## Known Issues / Bugs
- [ ] Snooze reminder: sometimes the grid cell updates only after I press "Refresh" (not auto-updated).
- [ ] Times input accepts invalid formats (e.g., "8:aa") without warning.
- [ ] Days mask is flexible but not strictly validated; entering nonsense like "xyz" defaults to all days.

## TODO (for Version 2)
- Add ability to edit/delete existing medications.
- Auto-detect “missed” doses (if scheduled time passes without action).
- Persist snoozes across app restarts.
